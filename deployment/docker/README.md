## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker
```

For more information regarding the Docker deployment, you should check TorchServe's 
explanation and notes available at [pytorch/serve/docker](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/docker), 
as it also explains how to use their Docker image (instead of a clear Ubuntu one) and
some tips regarding the production deployment of the models using TorchServe.
